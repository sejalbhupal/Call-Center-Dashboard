Call Center Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes key performance metrics from a call center dataset, including:

Customer Satisfaction Ratings - Shows how customers rated their experience with agents (1.25%, 2.75%, 3.75% across three categories)

Call Volume - Displays the percentage of calls answered during different time periods (30%, 20%, 15%)

Response Times - Measures how quickly calls were answered (0.5%, 0.5%, 1.5% across intervals)

Advanced Queue Time (QT) - Tracks wait times in queue (10%, 12%)

The dataset appears to be a single-page snapshot of call center operations, useful for understanding agent performance, call handling efficiency, and customer experience metrics.

Perfect for:

Call center managers

Customer service analysts

Operations researchers

Anyone interested in contact center performance metrics

The clean, percentage-based format makes it easy to visualize trends and identify areas for improvement in call center operations.
